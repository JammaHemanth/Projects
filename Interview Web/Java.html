	<p> 1. What is Java? <br>
	 Java is an high-level,object oreinted platform independent programming language <br> 
	 It was developed by James Gosling in 1991 <br>
	 It can also known as platform as it provide it's own JRE & API</p>
	 
	 <p>2. What is Platform? <br>
	 A plaform is the hardware or software enviorment in which a piece of software is executed </p>
	 
	 <p>3. What is Java Virtual Machine(JVM)? <br>
	 JVM is a virtual machine that enables the computer to run the java program <br> 
	 JVM acts like a run-time engine which calls the main method present in java code <br>
	 Java code is compiled by JVM to a byte code which is machine independent and close to native code </p>
	 
	 <p>4.What is java Run-time enviorment(JRE)?<br>
	  It is a implementation of JVM and JRE is a set of software tool which are used for developing java applications </p>
	  
	 <p>5.What is Java Development Tool Kit(JDK)? <br>
	 It is a software development environment which is used to develop Java applications and applets</p>
	 
	 <p>6.What is Just in time Compiler(JIT)? <br>
	  It is used to improve the performance. JIT compiles parts of the bytecode that have similar functionality at the same time, and hence reduces the amount of time needed for           compilation.</p>	 

	 <p>7.What gives Java its 'write once and run anywhere' nature?? <br>
	  Java compiler converts the Java programs into the class file (Byte Code) which is the intermediate language between source code and machine code. This bytecode is not platform           specific and can be executed on any computer.</p>	 

	 <p>8.What is Object Cloning? <br>
	  It is an ability to recreate an object entirely similar to an existing object is known as object cloning</p>	 
	  
	 <p>9.What is Package? <br>
	  A package is a collection of related classes and interfaces providing access protection and namespace mangement</p>	 

	 <p>10.What is wrapper class? <br>
	  In java when you declare primitive data type, then wrapper classes are responsible for converting them to object</p>	 

	 <p>11.What is OOPS? <br>
	  OOPS is abbrevated as Object Oreinted Programming system in which programs are considered as a collection of objects. Each object is nothing but an instance of class </p>	 

	 <p>12.What is class? <br>
	  A class is simply a representation of a type of object. It is a blueprint/plan/template that describes the details of an object</p>	 

	 <p>13.What is object? <br>
	  An object is an instance of class. It has it's own state,behavior and identity</p>	 

	 <p>14.What is Encapsulation? <br>
	  It is defined as a wrapping of data in a single unit, it is more defined with setter and getter code. It is also known as the combination of data hiding and abstraction</p>	 

	 <p>15.What is abstraction? <br>
	  The process of hiding the innner details of an application from the outer world</p>	 

	 <p>16.What is inheritance? <br>
	  The mechanism where a new class is derived from existing class</p>	 

	 <p>17.What is Polymorphism? <br>
	  Polymorphism is nothing but assigning behavior or value in a subclass to something that was already declared in the main class.Simply, Polymorphism takes more than one form <br>
	  <ul>
		<li>
          <u>Compile-time Polymorphism:</u> It allows you to create more than one function with same name and different signature <br>
		</li>
	<li>
          <u>Run-time Polymorphism:</u> It allows you to create more than one function with same name and same signature</p>	       
                    </li>
	  </ul>

	 <p>18.What is method-overloading? <br>
	  It is the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters in the same class</p>	 

	 <p>19.What is method-overriding? <br>
	  It is the ability to provide a different implementation of a method in a subclass that is already defined in it's superclass</p>	 

	 <p>20.What is method? <br>
	  A method in java is a block of code that performs a specific task</p>	 

	 <p>21.What is local variable? <br>
	  A local variable can be anywhere inside a method or a specific block of code</p>	 

	 <p>22.What is Global Variable? <br>
	  A global variable can be declared outside the function and are accessible through out the program</p>	 

	 <p>23.What is object cloning? <br>
	  It is an ability to recreate an object entirely similar to an existing object known as object cloning</p>
