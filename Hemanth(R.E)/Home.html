     <u><b>Objectives:</b></u><br><ul>Royal Enfield's objective is to disrupt the existing status quo by creating a new category in motorcycling globally - one that heralds a return to fun and evocative mid-size motorcycling (where motorcycling refers to owning, riding, caring for, and living with a motorcycle).The Enfield Cycle Company made motorcycles, bicycles, lawnmowers and stationary engines under the name Royal Enfield out of its works based at Redditch, Worcestershire. The legacy of weapons manufacture is reflected in the logo comprising the cannon, and the motto "Made like a gun".
